          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p class="bottomtext">BananaTree is based on the simple idea that shelter is a fundamental human right.</p>

          <p class="bottomtext">BananaTree was created by alumni of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in San Francisco. We believe a good night's rest and a warm shower can do wonders for people's morale and make it easier for them to find sustainable work and permanent housing.</p>

          <p class="bottomtext">BananaTree is an open-source project. We welcome community feedback and support as we consider how to best improve the lives of people living on the street.</p>
